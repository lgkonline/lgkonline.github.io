If you want to know, why this service could be helpful you should checkout this tutorial at DevDashboard:

It converts the FontAwesome icon library into a static C# class containing all icons with their unicodes.
This allows you to quickly use those icons by name.

The data will get received directly from the FontAwesome GitHub project, so it is always up-to-date.
